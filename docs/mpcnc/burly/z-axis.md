# Z Axis

!!! info "Important"
    Please do not attach anything to this assembly above the tool mount.  You will see lots of
    images of people attaching cable chains, wires, and vacuum hoses to the motor mount. This is the
    absolute **worst** place on the entire machine to attach anything! It will act as a torque
    multiplier and completely ruin your accuracy/precision. Anything necessary should be attached to
    the main gantry assembly there is lots of room on the XYZ piece.

The tool mount piece uses either #6 lock nuts or M4. Insert the nuts facing the right direction and
if they are not a snug fit a tiny drop of glue in the corner will keep them from falling out. I add
one after they are inserted right at the corner of each nut just to be safe. I use cyanoacrylate
gel. It is not doing anything other making sure they do not fall out when not in use, if they are in
use they do not depend on the glue at all.

Insert the 4 nuts into the nut traps, if they aren’t a tight fit a drop of glue here will help in
assembly later.

Insert the nut traps into your cut and drilled Z rails, pointed end up. Align the holes. Get all
four screws 3/4″ (M4 X 20) started but leave them extremely loose for a later alignment step.

Press the bearing into the Z-Lower bracket. Make sure it is seated all the way and not crooked.

Tighten the coupler onto the shaft, first tighten grub screw on the stepper shaft flat spot, then
the grub screw on the round part. Make sure the shaft is most of the way into the coupler as shown
in the cutaway. Use 3 M3x10mm screws to attach the stepper to the Z-Motor bracket.

Do not insert the Lead Screw yet. The picture is to show you how far the shaft should be set.

Use no screws on the Z mounts yet. Slide the Z-lower bracket onto the z rails open bearing side will
face away from the tool mount. Slide it all the way to just above the tool mount. Next add the motor
mount. This step lets you align the rails and snug up the tool mount 4 screws 3/4″ (M4 X 20). Snug,
if you hear a crack you went overboard.

Slide the lower tool mount to where it just touches the coupler but does not compress it at all.

!!! warning "IMPORTANT STEP"
    Make sure the coupler touches the bearing so it can support the weight of the tool.
    We are using the ball bearing as a thrust bearing (not the right type of bearing but it is a tiny load).

At this point hang the assembly off the edge of a table. Make sure the rails are sitting flat on the
table, if it is not loosening, push down on the rails, and tighten the tool mount screws. If the rails
are twisted it will rock back and forth…that is bad.

Try to get the gap between mounts to be relatively equal while still touching the coupler and
bearing. This dimension will be different for every build. Check again, are the rails still flat?

Add the screws 3/4″ (M4 X 20) and nuts to the Z brackets, snug slightly.

**Snug slightly means, less than you think**. If it is too loose at some point the mounts could move up
and is very easily noticed and is easily fixed by going a very tiny bit snugger. If they are too
tight you will crack the mount, not easily fixed. Err on the side of too loose.

Check again, are the rails still sitting flat? Add the lead screw into the coupler. **The lead screw
should touch the motor shaft** to fight thrust in the other direction from the lower mount bearing.
Again, not the best engineering solution but it works great with this light load. The lead screw
should be at least as long as the [calculator](../calculator.md) specifies, but no longer than the bottom of the Z
rails.

If you are having a hard time getting the lead screw through the bearing, lightly sand or file the
top 25mm (1″) or so of the lead screw. It can be a tight fit.

**Lube** the lead screw. White lithium is great, but really anything will work.

Done with the Z Axis!
